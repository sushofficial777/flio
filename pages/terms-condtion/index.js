          <h2>PRICE MATCH PROMISE</h2>
          <h3>When booking with FlioTravels, we want you to be confident that you have found a great deal.</h3>
          <p>That’s why, if you see a lower price (including taxes and fees) for the same flight itinerary offered and available for booking on a Major OTA Competitor’s site within twenty-four (24) hours of booking, we will match that lower price by refunding the difference in price, or if you prefer, we will cancel your booking with us for a full refund.</p>
          <h3>That’s our Price Match Promise (“PMP”).</h3>
          <p>Questions? Here are some answers:</p>
          <h3>What does “the same itinerary” mean?</h3>
          <p>The same itinerary means that each and every element of each offer matches; airline(s), flight number(s), itinerary, date(s), number of customers and seat type.</p>
          <h3>What does “offered and available for booking” mean?</h3>
          <p>It means that the itinerary you found is actually live on a Major OTA Competitor’s site and available to be booked by the general public at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives.</p>
          <h3>What is a “Major OTA Competitor”?</h3>
          <p>For purposes of the PMP, it means the U.S. English-language websites of Expedia.com, Orbitz.com, Priceline.com and Travelocity.com.</p>
          <h3>How do I notify you that I want to invoke the PMP?</h3>
          <p>To invoke the PMP, all you need to do is contact us at pmp@FlioTravels.com with your FlioTravelsbooking number and all of the key details of the lower priced itinerary (airline(s), flight(s), itinerary, date(s), number of customers and seat type), along with documentation such as the exact URL or screen shots that will enable our customer service representatives to verify that such itinerary satisfies the terms and conditions of the PMP. Customer service must be able to locate the lower fare from the information you provide; we reserve the right to deny any claims that cannot be reasonably verified, or for which you have provided incomplete information. Once our representative has verified that the PMP applies, you will be given the choice to either keep your itinerary with a refund of the difference in total price, or cancel your booking with us for a full refund.</p>
          <h3>Are there exceptions that apply to the PMP?</h3>
          <p>The PMP does not apply to fares offered on membership program websites, corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, or consolidator fares; or fares available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. Military, student, government, tour operator, bulk, vacation package or &rdquo;Web Only&rdquo;fares are excluded. The PMP does not apply to “opaque” tickets (where the airline booking details are unknown until after purchase) or tickets issued under a “bidding” or “auction” model. Fare errors are also excluded.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="border-bottom">

          <h2>PRICE DROP ASSURANCE TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
          <p>Price Drop Assurance is an opt-in service in which you authorize us to look for additional savings on airline ticket(s) that you booked with us, which we then share with you in the form of a FlioTravelsgift card.</p>
          <p>When you purchase the Price Drop Assurance service, we will search your exact itinerary (travel dates, airports, passengers, airlines & flights) for 24 hours after you book your ticket(s) to look for opportunities to realize additional savings on those ticket(s). If we identify an opportunity to realize additional savings, you authorize us to rebook your ticket(s) for the same exact itinerary that you already purchased. We will then share those savings with you in the form of a gift card good toward any future flight booking on FlioTravels.com. We will also retain a portion of the savings as a rebooking fee for providing this service.</p>
          <p>The Price Drop Assurance service is not a guarantee of savings. If we are unable to find meaningful additional savings on your exact itinerary (typically $30 or more), your original tickets will remain in place and we will be unable to offer you any additional value. Price Drop Assurance is not available for all itineraries or all airlines, but will only be offered when available.</p>
          <p>
            Please be aware that If we reissue your tickets to realize additional savings as described above, you will receive a new confirmation email with new ticket number(s) for the new tickets that we have issued to you. We strongly recommend that if you sign up for the Price Drop Assurance service, you do not purchase any ancillary services, such as seats or prepaid bags, directly from the airline until after the 24-hour search period has ended. IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED ANY ANCILLARY SERVICES, SUCH AS SEATS OR PREPAID BAGS, DIRECTLY FROM THE AIRLINE IN THE INTERIM, YOU WILL NEED TO CALL THE AIRLINE AND REQUEST THAT THEY ASSOCIATE THOSE ITEMS WITH YOUR NEW TICKET NUMBER(S), RATHER THAN YOUR ORIGINAL ONE(S). Airline rules may restrict the transferability of ancillary services to new tickets or specify that such items are non-refundable; therefore, FlioTravelscannot guarantee that these requests will be honored. Note that if you use a debit card for this service, depending upon your issuing bank it may take up to five to seven business days for you to regain access to the funds held for purchase of your original ticket.</p>
          <p>NOTE THAT THE ORIGINAL FARE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR A FULL REFUND IF REQUESTED WITHIN 24-HOURS OF BOOKING.   OTHER FARES MAY BE REFUNDABLE PURSUANT TO THE ORIGINAL FARE RULES.  BY SIGNING UP FOR PRICE DROP ASSURANCE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE WE HAVE COMMENCED THE REBOOKING PROCESS, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A REFUND (IF ELIGIBLE) ON THE ORIGINAL TICKET AND ELECT TO APPLY ANY REFUND TO THE PURCHASE OF THE REBOOKED TICKET AND FlioTravels’S REBOOKING FEE.  THE REBOOKED TICKET(S) WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A REFUND TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE ORIGINAL TICKET(S), AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE AIRLINE’S RULES AND RESTRICTIONS, AS WELL AS FlioTravels’S TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

        <div className="border-bottom">
          <h2>FlioTravelsConnection Protection</h2>
          <p>
            FlioTravelsConnection Protection is a feature available on certain Fusion Fare flights and is designed to assist you should you be impacted by an involuntary schedule change, delay or cancellation of your confirmed flight resulting from some events that occur in the standard course of air transportation.

            When you purchase an itinerary that is covered by FlioTravelsConnection Protection, in the event of an involuntary schedule change or cancellation, we will make reasonable attempts to find you an alternative flight option(s) or other acceptable means of transportation to your destination (or refund the cost of your unused ticket should no options be available). If you are affected by an involuntary change to your itinerary you should immediately reach out to FlioTravelsand not the airline in order to be covered under this policy.


            This option applies whenever a schedule change such as a flight change or cancellation affects the first leg of your confirmed itinerary, which prevents you from reaching your final destination, or your arrival in destination is delayed by more than 24 hours after the original arrival time (i.e., you would either miss your connecting flight(s) or your flight(s) is cancelled).
            <b>IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A SCHEDULE CHANGE ON YOUR FUSION FARE ITINERARY, YOU MUST GET IN TOUCH WITH US IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT DELAY EITHER BY TELEPHONE, EMAIL OR VIA OUR ONLINE CHAT PLATFORM FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE</b>
            . At this time, we have no way of tracking whether there has been a change to your itinerary, so if you fail to contact us in a timely manner, you will not be covered under FlioTravelsConnection Protection.  Once we are informed of the change or cancellation, at our discretion, we will offer you one of the following resolutions:
          </p>
          <p>We will find you alternative transportation to your destination. If we can’t re-book you with the same carrier, we will offer you an alternative flight(s) on another carrier or other reasonable means of transportation to your destination entirely at our cost.</p>
          <p>If no alternative can be offered and once we are in mutual agreement, you can purchase the similar ticket at the airport in the same cabin className
            and we will refund you the price difference between the two tickets. Any other extra services or upgrades related to these new tickets will not be covered under this policy.</p>
          <p>For all unused portions, we will refund you accordingly. This option will be offered if we fail to offer you an alternative transportation.</p>
          <p>The options will be communicated to you via phone or email. You must respond to us promptly in ALL cases within the 24 hours of receiving our options.  Once the 24-hour offer period is over, our options becomes null and void and you will not be entitled to FlioTravelsConnection Protection.
            <br /><b>FlioTravelsAdditional services covered:</b>   Any covered travel arrangements must be prearranged with our Customer care team, as these are solely covered at our discretion. The costs associated with these services must be paid upfront by you and then claimed after the fact with valid proof (transaction receipts).  We will refund the costs up to the amounts listed below.
            <br /> <b>Overnight Hotel Accommodations:</b> If your alternative connecting flight is scheduled for eight or more hours after your original departure, FlioTravelsConnection Protection will provide overnight hotel accommodations. In some cases, you will have to book the hotel room locally and claim a refund of USD $50 per person up to two nights. If additional nights are required due to lack of availability with the airline for an alternative, it must be mutually arranged in advance with FlioTravels. <b>Airport Transfers:</b> If all alternative flights to your destination are sold out for same-day travel, we will cover the costs of a transfer to a nearby airport if the next available flight to your destination departs from that airport. All airport transfers must be prearranged with FlioTravels. Airport transfers may be via train, coach bus or a taxi and will apply to all the passengers booked on the same reservation. The maximum aggregate claim limit for this is USD $100 for all passengers on the same reservation.
            <br /> <b>Meal and Beverage compensation:</b>  If your flight connection is delayed by more than 4 hours, we will cover up to US $15 per person booked on a covered itinerary.
            <br /><b>Multiple destination routes:</b> If the covered itinerary is impacted such that the remaining segments on the same ticket are all impacted, and we are unable to find a suitable alternative and the ticket is fully unused, then a refund for all flights on that ticket can be applied.
            <br /><b>Communication and notices:</b> Once we provide you with alternative options, your response is required within 48 hours the latest in exceptional cases. If the 48-hour window has passed, the offer becomes null and void and is no longer covered under FlioTravelsConnection Protection.
            <br /><b>Important: If you are offered the above-mentioned alternatives by the airline(s) directly or at the airport, we cannot be held responsible for any further compensation or reimbursement.</b>
            <br /><b>Late Check-ins / No Shows</b>   FlioTravelsConnection Protection is intended to assist when, due to no fault of your own, you miss your connecting flight on an eligible itinerary.  However, if FlioTravelsdetermines (based on the information provided by the operating carriers/booking systems) that the passenger has had sufficient connecting time (even after a delayed arrival),  FlioTravelsConnection Protection will not apply. Any related costs will become the passenger’s responsibility in any such cases.

YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.

          </p>
          <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT</h2>
          <p>
            For disputes or claims you have against FlioTravels, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to 1-646-738-4820 or feedback@FlioTravels.com. You and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with us during that time.


            If we are unable to resolve your claim within 60 days despite those good faith efforts, then either you or we may start arbitration or small claims court proceedings.


            Claims shall be resolved via binding arbitration initiated through AAA except for claims asserted on an individual basis that are properly filed in a small claims court.


            For small claims court proceedings: if your claim falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, then either party may choose to take the claim to small claims court instead of arbitration. Either party may seek to have a claim resolved in small claims court in your county of residence or the small claims court in closest proximity to your residence, and you may also bring a claim in small claims court in New York County, the State of New York, USA. The parties may take their claims to small claims court without first filing with AAA. After a case is filed with AAA, but before the arbitrator is formally appointed to the case by AAA, a party can send a written notice to the opposing party and AAA that it wants the case decided by a small claims court. After receiving this notice, AAA will administratively close the case without further inquiry. Any dispute about whether a claim falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such dispute, the arbitration proceeding shall remain closed unless and until a decision by the small claims court that the claim is not within its jurisdiction.


            Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, except as set forth below, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the Terms &amp; Conditions as a court would.


            The arbitration will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) and the AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol, Statement of Principles, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by AAA. The AAA Rules and Consumer Due Process Protocol, Statement of Principles are available online at
            or by calling AAA at +1 844-899-3738. If you initiate arbitration the only fee you shall be required to pay is US $200; all other costs will be borne by the Company, except in the event that the arbitrator determines that the claims were frivolous, the arbitrator may award to the prevailing party the costs and attorneysfees reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration, except that, in arbitrations proceeding in California, the arbitrator is not empowered to award the prevailing party the fees and costs it incurred in connection with the arbitration.


            Notwithstanding the provision above with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms &amp; Conditions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16, the “FAA”) and any dispute about the interpretation of this arbitration clause shall be covered by the FAA. AAA and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator approved by or otherwise affiliated with AAA; (b) the party initiating the arbitration shall choose the form in which they would like the arbitration to be conducted: via telephone, online, solely based on written submissions, or at an in-person hearing; (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, if either party requests an in-person hearing: (i) the arbitrator shall decide whether a hearing is necessary or whether the arbitration should proceed via telephone, online or solely based on written submissions, (ii) if the arbitrator deems that a hearing is necessary, the hearing shall occur at a mutually agreed upon location, or, if the parties are unable to agree on a location, at a location that is selected by the arbitrator and is reasonably convenient to all parties, and (iii) either party may elect to participate in an in-person hearing by phone, unless the arbitrator decides otherwise; (d) the arbitrator may not award any: (i) incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits, or (ii) punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages described in subparagraphs (d)(i) and (d)(ii); (e) the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&apos;s claim; and (f) unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&apos;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or className
            proceeding.


            The arbitrator shall decide all issues relating to jurisdiction and arbitrability and the interpretation, applicability, formation, existence, validity, scope or enforceability of this Mandatory Arbitration provision. Claims, if any, determined by the arbitrator not to be within the scope of this Mandatory Arbitration provision must be brought exclusively in a Federal or State court located in New York County, the State of New York, USA. If subparagraph (f) above is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Mandatory Arbitration provision shall be null and void. Judgment on the award issued by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Mandatory Arbitration provision shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

          <h2>BOOKING PROCESS</h2>
          <p>
            For your convenience, our use of the following terms in these Terms &amp; Conditions shall have the meaning below:


            <h2>&#39;Service Element</h2>
            - a singular product or service listed on the Site that can be booked independently of any other service. (
            <i>e.g.</i>
            : car, hotel, flight).


            <h2>&#39;Travel Supplier&#39;</h2>
            - a vendor of one or more Service Elements. (
            <i>e.g.</i>
            : hotels, car suppliers, airlines). FlioTravelsdoes not act as principal but makes arrangements with third-party vendor Travel Suppliers for Service Elements, all as defined above.


            <h2>&#39;Booking&#39;</h2>
            - a negotiation process with the Travel Supplier carried out by you while using this Site for the purpose of obtaining one or more Service Elements that may result in a contract with the Travel Supplier at the time we receive full payment and accept your offer.


            In order to complete a Booking the following steps are taken to ensure its validity:

            When we place Service Elements on our Site, we are inviting you to make an offer for their purchase.  You do not make this offer until you press &rdquo;Book&rdquo; on the payment page (entitled &rdquo;Review Trip Details and Book&rdquo;) of the Site.


            Once you have done so you have made
            FlioTravels
            an offer (which cannot be withdrawn if you change your mind) to purchase the relevant Service Element(s) from the relevant Travel Supplier(s) (your &rdquo;Booking&rdquo;).  We are free to accept your offer on behalf of the relevant Travel Supplier or to reject it, at our sole discretion.


            The
            FlioTravels
            email confirmation is NOT the contractual acceptance of the Booking, but merely an acknowledgement that we have received your offer. We will need to check the availability of the relevant Service Element(s).


            If the relevant Service Element is available, your Booking will be processed.  The contract pertaining to the relevant Booking  is formed when payment in full has been received.


            The contract between you and the relevant Travel Supplier will relate only to those Service Elements confirmed by email with ticket numbers in case of air or reservation numbers in case of hotels, cars or activities.


            The terms of your Booking (such as price, availability and/or dates of travel) are not guaranteed until the contract is formed between you and the Travel Supplier and a ticket has been issued and/or a reservation has been made and confirmed by the Travel Supplier. Please note that once you have completed the Booking stage you can only cancel or change the details (such as names or destinations) of your Booking at our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms &amp; Conditions.


            These Booking processes will apply to any of our individual Service Element&apos;s Terms &amp; Conditions set out below. The airline ticket Terms &amp; Conditions, the hotel Terms &amp; Conditions, the car rental Terms &amp; Conditions, the attractions and services Terms &amp; Conditions supplement any area not covered by the Booking process. We reserve the right to change the Booking process at any time, with changes automatically taking effect from the date such changes are posted on the Site.


            At all times throughout your trip a government-issued photo ID is required for security checks at airports, hotels and car rental locations and may be required for attractions and other products as deemed necessary by the relevant Travel Suppliers.


            In addition to the required government-issued ID as stated above, proof of citizenship (Passport) is required for international travel (for most countries outside of the United States). Please note that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that you meet the passport, visa, and/or health requirements of the countries you wish to visit and those that you transit (even if it is for a simple flight change).  Many countries require that your passport should be valid for a minimum period from the date of arrival into that country.  For any questions regarding what the applicable minimum period is and any other conditions or passport/visa requirements for travel, you should contact the corresponding local consulate of the countries to which you are travelling.


            Neither
            FlioTravels
            nor its affiliates accept any responsibility, and you will not be entitled to any refunds whatsoever, if you are denied boarding, delayed or deported due to non-fulfillment of the above.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Government entry/exit fees may apply, depending on your destination.</li>
            <li>These are your sole responsibility and will be additional to your Booking charges.</li>
            <li> All travelers on your Booking (if more than one passenger) must travel on the same itinerary. Individual passengers cannot be added to, and/or deleted from your Booking. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            FlioTravels
            reserves the right to correct errors in any advertised price and, if applicable, give you an option to either cancel the Booking or allow

            Most of our airline tickets are
            <h2>100% non-refundable</h2>
            . In certain cases where the airline may allow cancellations, a credit may be valid towards a future ticket purchase by the same traveler on the same airline. Usually the credit issued by the airline supplier   has a specific expiration date, after which it cannot be used. We encourage you to discuss additional restrictions attached to your credit with a customer service agent. All such bookings where the cancellation may be permitted must be cancelled prior to the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment by calling our customer service center. We do not guarantee any cancellation. When you are ready to make  your new booking and wish to use your airline credit, you will be required to the pay fare difference (if any), applicable airline penalties and any applicable
            FlioTravels
            post-ticketing fees. All such changes are governed by each airline&apos;s fare rules, policies and procedures, which are not under our control.


            No additional representation is made for our exchange fees except that an agent will assist you in locating your desired new flights and attempt to re-book the new flights based on availability and other factors. we offer Special Discounts for Military, Bereavement, and the Visually Impaired.

          <h2>MULTIPLE AIRLINE ITINERARIES</h2>
          <p>If your itinerary includes flights operated by more than one airline, please read carefully each such airline&apos;s terms and conditions, which can be found on each such airline&apos;s website. Each such airline will have its own restrictions, rules and fees. If one of these flights is affected by an airline change (e.g. cancellation or rescheduling) that causes a Customer to make changes to the other flight, the Customer may be responsible for any fees or ticket cost incurred for making changes to the unaffected flight. Such airlines may charge their own fees for changes, refunds, or if exchanges are requested. You are responsible for complying with each airline&apos;s terms and conditions, which may differ (for example, check-in times and limits on baggage size/weight). It is advisable you print your outbound and return portions of your e-ticket confirmation for all flights prior to travelling. You may be asked for proof of your return ticket at check-in.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="border-bottom">
          <h2>CANCEL AND REFUND</h2>
          <p>Most of our airline tickets, hotels, pre-paid car rentals, vacation packages and service fees are non-refundable after 24 hours of booking. Trip protection insurance is refundable within 10 days of purchase if travel has not commenced and you have called our customer service center to cancel. All cancellations must be done over the phone only. We can accept refund requests only if the following conditions have been met:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>you have applied for a cancellation and refund with us and if the fare rules provide for cancellation and refunds;</li>
            <li>you are not a &#39;no show&#39; (most &#39;no show&#39; bookings are in-eligible for any waiver from suppliers for refund processing); and</li>
            <li>we are able to secure waivers from suppliers to process this requested cancellation and refund.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We are unable to provide a specific time line for how long it may take for this requested refund to be processed. All refund requests are processed in a sequential format. Once you have provided our customer service agent with your cancellation request, we will then send you an email notification that your request has been received. This notification does not automatically qualify you for a refund. This only provides you with an acknowledgement of your request and provides you with a tracking number. Upon receipt of your request we will work with the suppliers such as airlines, hotels, car-rental companies to generate a waiver based on airline and other supplier rules and notify you of the supplier decision. Our services fees associated with the original travel reservation or booking are not refundable. Please note that we are dependent on the suppliers for receiving the requested refunds. Once the refund has been approved by the supplier it may take additional time for this to appear on your credit card statement. Generally, all suppliers will charge a penalty for refund. This entire process may take 60-90 days from receipt of your request to receiving credit on your statement. Apart from the airlines and other suppliers refund penalties,
            FlioTravels
            will charge a post-ticketing services fee, as applicable. All refund fees are charged on per-passenger, per-ticket basis. These fees will only be assessed if a refund has been authorized by the supplier or a waiver has been received and when the airline/supplier rules permit such refunds. If such refund is not processed by the supplier, we will refund you our post-ticketing service fees applicable to your agent assisted refund request , but not our booking fees for the original travel reservation or booking.
            we offer Special Discounts for Military, Bereavement, and the Visually Impaired.

          <h2>Collecting Points</h2>
          <p>
            The amount of Points a Program member earns will depend on the service purchased and the Program member’s tier status.


          </p>
          <p>
            Members at the Silver Tier or higher earn Points as follows:


          </p>
          <h2>Airline Tickets</h2>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Earn one (1) Point for every U.S. dollar spent on stand-alone flights through the FlioTravels.com or OneTravel.com branded desktop or mobile websites.</li>
            <li>Earn one (1) Point for every Canadian dollar spent on stand-alone flights through the FlioTravels.ca branded desktop or mobile website.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Ancillary Offerings</h2>
          <p>
          </p><ul>
            <li>Earn two (2) Points for every U.S. dollar spent on an Ancillary Offering that is combined with the purchase of flights, hotels or rental cars through the FlioTravels.com or OneTravel.com branded desktop or mobile websites.</li>
            <li>Earn two (2) Points for every Canadian dollar spent on an Ancillary Offering that is combined with the purchase of flights, hotels or rental cars through the FlioTravels.ca branded desktop or mobile website.</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>In addition, Points multiply at the Gold and Platinum tiers, as follows:</p><p>
          </p><ul>
            <li><b>Gold Members</b>: Points are doubled on each Qualifying Purchase.</li>
            <li><b>Platinum Members</b>: Points are tripled on each Qualifying Purchase.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Gold Members</b>
            : Points are doubled on each Qualifying Purchase.
          </p>


          <p>
            And purchasing using one of our brands’ mobile applications doubles your points earned on top of any tier multiplier.


          </p>
          <p>
            Qualifying Purchases can be made online on the Sites for the applicable brand that offers ClubMiles membership. No Points will be provided for purchases of stand-alone Ancillary Offerings. Except where required by law or provided for in these Terms, Points have no cash value. Points have no exchange rate to any market currency.


          </p>
          <p>
            ClubMiles will attempt to credit your Account with the awarded Points on a timely basis, usually thirty (30) days after the booked travel was completed. Points are not earned on bookings that are cancelled. Changes or cancellations to the booked itinerary may result in differences between the estimated number of pending points calculated and the ultimate number of points that are credited to your Account for that itinerary. However, you have the responsibility of making sure that your Points are properly credited. Please retain copies of your purchases for your records. Any claim for Points not credited accurately must be received by us within six (6) months of the date of claimed accrual of such Points.


          </p>
          <p>
            For clarity, where a purchase is made in whole via redemption of the Points, the portion of such purchase that includes a Points redemption will not be included in the total of the Qualifying Purchase. Points you earn upon making a Qualifying Purchase cannot be redeemed for that purchase and can only be redeemed for a subsequent Qualifying Purchase.


          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of any ambiguity, uncertainty or dispute as to whether any particular itinerary or part thereof is a Qualifying Purchase, ClubMiles shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine whether such travel is a Qualifying Purchase.


          </p>
          <p>Points may also be awarded to you by ClubMiles as a goodwill gesture in the context of customer service (e.g., courtesy waiver of applicable fees). To avail yourself of these courtesy points, you will need to sign up for the Program on a Site.</p>
          <div className
            ="clearfix10"></div>
          <h2>Points Expiration</h2>
          <p>In general, Points will not expire as long as a Qualifying Purchase was made through your ClubMiles Account with any of the Sites at least once every two (2) years. &rdquo;Qualifying Purchase&rdquo; means a Points-eligible booking that has been completed through one of the Sites or over the phone, and has been confirmed in the case of flight bookings, or consumed in the case of hotel and rental car booking (meaning hotel check-out date or end of the rental car period). Points on your Account shall expire if no Qualifying Purchase was made through your Account with any of the Sites for the preceding two (2) year period; however, Points rewarded as a customer service courtesy will expire on the expiration date assigned to them and should be redeemed before the assigned date.</p>
          <div className
            ="clearfix10"></div>
          <h2>Redeeming Points</h2>
          <p>
            Points can be redeemed via instant redemption while booking on the Sites. You must have a minimum of 1000 Points in order to use instant redemption. The Points are redeemable for service fees charged by us and/or our affiliates in connection with your flight booking (“Service Fees”) and fees charged by us and/or our affiliates when you purchase certain Ancillary Offerings (as defined below) (“Ancillary Offering Fees”). Service Fees exclude Enhanced Seat Assignment Fee, Baggage Service Fee, Post Ticketing Fees. The maximum savings from the redemption of Points on flights and Ancillary Offerings is the value of Service Fees and Ancillary Offering Fees. The exact number of Points required to redeem for certain Service Fees or Ancillary Offering Fees will be shown online on the applicable Site. ClubMiles reserves the right in its sole discretion to change the redemption options offered as well as the number of points needed to redeem for certain Service Fees or Ancillary Offering Fees at any time. ClubMiles also reserves the right to limit the quantity of Points an Account may redeem in a single transaction. Gift cards redeemed through the Program must be fulfilled online. All gift cards are subject to the issuer&apos;s own Terms &amp; Conditions. At ClubMiles’ discretion the Program may also allow you to use Points to get a discount off of certain types of travel or travel-related items booked on FlioTravels.com.

          <p>By applying for and opening a FlioTravelsCredit Card (“FlioTravelsCredit Card”), FlioTravelsVisa® Card, or FlioTravelsVisa Signature® Card (each a “FlioTravelsVisa Card”), you hereby agree to be bound by these Credit Rewards Terms. In addition, you acknowledge you have previously enrolled in the FlioTravelsRewards Program (the “Rewards Program”), or if you have not, you agree to be enrolled in the Rewards Program, and to be bound by the Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (“Rewards Program Terms”), which are available at FlioTravelsCardRewards.com.</p>

          <h2>Make Purchases with your FlioTravelsCredit Card or FlioTravelsVisa Card and Earn Reward Points</h2>
          <p>When you make an eligible net purchase (eligible purchases minus credits, returns and adjustments) (“Eligible Purchase”) with your FlioTravelsCredit Card or FlioTravelsVisa Card, you will automatically earn points in your Rewards Program account if your FlioTravelsCredit Card or FlioTravelsVisa Card account is open and in good standing both at the time you make an Eligible Purchase and at the end of your billing cycle during which you made an Eligible Purchase.  Points earned for an Eligible Purchase will be calculated at the end of the billing cycle in which the Eligible Purchase was posted to your FlioTravelsCredit Card or FlioTravelsVisa Card account and will appear in your Rewards Program account within 60 days. Eligible Purchases do not include special financing purchases, balance transfers, cash advances, finance charges and fees associated with your credit card.</p>

          <h2>Earn Points with Your FlioTravelsCredit Card</h2>
          <p>When you use your FlioTravelsCredit Card for Eligible Purchases made at the FlioTravelswebsite or through the FlioTravelstelephone customer service center, you will earn 6 points for every US dollar spent, rounded to the nearest dollar.  “Book now, pay later” purchases made through FlioTravelsdo not earn rewards.</p>

          <p>
            <h2>Base Reward</h2>
            When you use your FlioTravelsVisa Card for Eligible Purchases made everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted, you will earn 2 points for every US dollar spent, rounded to the nearest dollar.

          <p>
            <h2>Dining</h2>
            When you use your FlioTravelsVisa Card for Eligible Purchases made at dining establishments, you will earn 2 additional points, for a total of 4 points for every US dollar spent, rounded to the nearest dollar.  Eligible Purchases made at dining establishments will be determined by the merchant category code (the &rdquo;MCC&rdquo;) associated with the merchant. A MCC is a four-digit className
            ification code that is assigned to a merchant by the merchant’s payment card network or merchant processor based on the predominant business activity of the merchant.  The merchant’s MCC will determine whether an Eligible Purchase qualifies as being made at a dining establishment for the 4 point reward.  For example, a dining purchase at the café area of a grocery store may have a MCC identification as a type of merchant other than a dining establishment and therefore would not qualify as a dining purchase under these Credit Reward Terms. Neither FlioTravelsnor Synchrony Bank assigns or has responsibility for the assignment of MCCs or evaluates what MCC should be assigned to a particular merchant.

          <p>All points earned with your FlioTravelsCredit Card or FlioTravelsVisa Card and credited to your Reward Program account can only be redeemed in accordance with the Rewards Program Terms through your Rewards Program account by visiting FlioTravels.com/rewards.

            <p>There can be many reasons why your credit or debit card may not have been approved or charged.

          <h2>AIRLINES SCHEDULE CHANGES/FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS</h2>
          <h2>Airline Policy on Schedule Changes:</h2>
          <p>
            All Airlines have differing rules and policies regarding schedule changes, which are beyond our control.


            Due to the operational needs of each airline, changes are often made to the flights that they are currently operating. Often these changes are a prediction of travel needs for a future dates but can also reflect same day changes. Types of changes could be: flight number changes, time changes, routing, date changes and or cancellations. Cancellations include when an airline has stopped or temporarily canceled service to certain cities, or stopped service on certain days of the week.
          </p>
          <h2>Cancellations:</h2>
          <h2>Reasons for cancellations or schedule changes may include:</h2>

          <p>peak or high travel seasons;</p>
          <p>low travel season;</p>
          <p>airport terminal or gate changes;</p>
          <p>fuel prices;</p>
          <p>civil unrest; and</p>
          <p>bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>
            FlioTravels
            does not assume any liability whatsoever for cancelled flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting due to any scheduled changes made by the airlines.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Policy on Schedule Changes:</h2>
          <p>We make every attempt to notify the customer of any schedule changes. It is always best to contact the airline to reconfirm your flights within 72 hours of departure.</p>
          <h2>Airline-Initiated Schedule Change(s):</h2>
          <p>
            Airlines sometimes initiate involuntary schedule changes due to a variety of reasons, such as changes in travel time, layover time, travel date, flight number, terminal changes, etc.
            These changes are made by the airline and are outside of our control. Some of these changes may be last-minute and/or occur while you are in transit.


            If your airline initiates changes to your flight itinerary, you will not be charged for change fees or differences in airfare.
          </p>
          <h2>Low Cost Carriers (LCCs)</h2>
          <p>
            If you booked your flight with a LCC, such as Frontier or Spirit, please contact your airline  directly regarding any change in schedule.
            Our agents are unable to assist you with any changes to LCC bookings.


            If you have chosen a combination of 2 one way tickets and one of the flights in your trip is operated by a LCC and the LCC initiated a change to that flight, please take the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <p>You need to contact the LCC directly to make changes to the booking.</p>
            <p>Once your changes are confirmed with the LCC, you may contact us if you need to make any additional changes to the non-LCC portion of your trip.</p>
          </ol>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Full Service Carrier</h2>
          <p>
            When any change(s) in schedule occurs on a full service carrier, we will work closely with the airline to provide you with a new flight option closest to your original flight time.
            Once we have a flight option, we will contact you. Some schedule changes require no action on your part. In other cases, you may need to take action,
            depending on the type of airline schedule change notification you receive from us and/or airline.
          </p>
          <h2>Prior to Departure</h2>
          <p>
            If an airline has a change to any of its flights within a 4 hour period of your original flight times, we will notify you of such change by email. We will attempt to contact you via other information provided by you, but; if we are unable to get in touch with you, our email will serve as final notice. For all such changes within a 4 hour period, tickets will remain non-refundable. Certain ticket types may be non-refundable even when the schedule change is over 4 hours.
            FlioTravels
            does not assume any liability whatsoever for cancelled flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting due to any scheduled changes made by the airlines.
          </p>

            Daily rates imply a 24 hour reservation period. Weekly rates imply a 5-7 day reservation period. You could be charged additional fees for cars returned at a different time or date or location from the original reservation. For example, holding the car for 27 hours could cost you a single daily rate, plus an hourly rate or half a day rate or a full day rate as imposed by the supplier for the additional 3 hours.


            Unlimited mileage rates have no restrictions on the number of miles you are allowed to drive. However, certain geographical restrictions may still apply.
